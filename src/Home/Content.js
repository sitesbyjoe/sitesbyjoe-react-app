        Over the years I've built it all for the web. These days I focus on:
      </h2>
      
      <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
      <p>One website, multiple screen sizes. From the first moment you could view a webpage on a mobile phone I was hooked on the possibilities of the mobile web. Today we have tons of advanced devices with screens ranging from 2 inches to over 60 inches in size viewing content on the web. I enjoy designing for all of them.</p>
      
      <h3>Web Programming and Development</h3>
      <p>Code is art. I enjoy designing interfaces that are simple to use, but just as much I enjoy writing code. I’m a skilled at fine languages like PHP and Javascript and can create solutions quickly and efficiently.</p>
      
      <h3>Consulting</h3>
      <p>Want to talk with someone who’s built it all? Whether you just want to talk shop or need someone to help you put together a winning strategy for a new website idea I can help.</p>
      
      <h3>CMS Development</h3>
      <p>I’ve built many content management systems for the web since first opening the studio. My experience can be put to work to help you create the perfect in-house platform to run your web business.</p>
